# url Parsing in href:

### 1. **Protocol-Relative URL (PRURL)**:
   - **Example**: `//example.com/path`
   - **Behavior**: 
     - The browser uses the protocol of the current document (e.g., `https:` or `http:`) for the resource.
     - If you're on an HTTPS page, `//example.com/path` becomes `https://example.com/path`.
   - **Use Case**: Commonly used when you want the resource to match the protocol of the current page, ensuring compatibility with both HTTP and HTTPS.

   - **Reference in RFC 3986**:
     - This is a subset of the generic URI syntax where the scheme is omitted, and the URL starts with `//`. 
     - **Section 3.3**: Path relative to a base URI.

---

### 2. **Absolute URL**:
   - **Example**: `https://example.com/path`
   - **Behavior**: 
     - Fully specifies the resource's location, including the scheme (`http` or `https`), domain, and path.
     - Always resolves to the specified domain and protocol.
   - **Use Case**: Best when linking to resources across different domains or when you want complete control over the scheme and domain.

---

### 3. **Relative URL**:
   - **Example**: `/path/to/resource`
   - **Behavior**: 
     - Resolves relative to the current domain.
     - If you're at `https://example.com/subdir/`, `/path/to/resource` resolves to `https://example.com/path/to/resource`.
   - **Use Case**: Simplifies linking within the same domain and allows for better portability across environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

---

### 4. **Base-Relative URL**:
   - **Example**: `path/to/resource`
   - **Behavior**: 
     - Resolves relative to the current **document's location**.
     - If you're at `https://example.com/subdir/`, `path/to/resource` resolves to `https://example.com/subdir/path/to/resource`.
     - otherwise if you're at `https:/example.com/dir/subdir`, `path/to/resource` resolve to `https://https:/example.com/dir/path/to/resource`.
   - **Use Case**: Useful for linking to nearby files within a directory structure.

---

### 5. **Data URL**:
   - **Example**: `data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUg...`
   - **Behavior**: 
     - Embeds the resource directly within the URL.
     - The `data:` scheme specifies inline data encoded in Base64 or plain text.
   - **Use Case**: Used for embedding small images or other data without additional HTTP requests.

   - **Reference in RFC 2397**:
     - Introduces the `data:` URL scheme for embedding resources.

### Key Details and RFC References:

- **RFC 3986: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Syntax**:
  - This RFC defines the general syntax of URIs, including absolute, relative, and protocol-relative URLs.
  - It covers:
    - Scheme (Section 3.1)
    - Authority (Section 3.2)
    - Path (Section 3.3)
    - Query (Section 3.4)
    - Fragment (Section 3.5)

- **RFC 7230: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1)**:
  - Discusses URL resolution in HTTP requests.
